All projects I did in the **Nanodegree Data Analyst of Udacity**
 
## Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends
In this project, I have analysed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends with where I live to overall global   temperatures
 
 
## Project 2 - Investigate The Movie Database
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
**My goal:** I put myself in the position of a filmmaker to pick one or several genres into the list of recommendations for producers.
Questions that I plan on exploring:
Which genres are most popular from 2013 to 2015?
5 genres make the most profit from 2013 to 2015?


## Project 3 - Analyze A_B Test Results
For this project, I have worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. **My goal** was to work through this to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision or add more varible to create better model to consider the result again .


## Project 4 - Data Wrangling
The dataset that I had worked for wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

**My goal:** Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for worthy analyses and visualizations.


## Project 5 - Visualization
**The project objective** is not expected to explore all of the variables in the dataset! But focus on only exploration on about 10-15 of them. Systematically starting from univariate visualizations, moving through bivariate visualizations, and finally multivariate visualizations. Finally, polishing up selected plots from the analysis for conveyed main points to others.

The dataset has 7,453,215 flights details with 29 features. The data ranges from Jan 1, 2007 to December 15, 2007.
There are 5 table, 2007.csv.bz2 contain records about flights, airports.csv contain records about airports, carriers.csv records about carriers, plane-data.csv contain records about plane, variable-descriptions.csv contain records about variable descriptions in the 2007.csv.bz2.
