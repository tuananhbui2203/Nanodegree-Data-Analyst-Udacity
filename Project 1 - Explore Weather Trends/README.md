# Project 1 - Exploring Weather Trends
In this project, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.
following steps:

1.Extract data from a database using SQL query:

    SELECT *
    FROM global_data;
    
    SELECT *
    FROM city_list
    WHERE country='Vietnam';
    
    SELECT *
    FROM city_data
    WHERE city='Hanoi';
    
2.Calculate a moving average in a spreadsheet

3.Create a line chart in a spreadsheet
