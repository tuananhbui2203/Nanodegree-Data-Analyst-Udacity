# Project 1 - Exploring Weather Trends
In this project, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.
following steps:

Extract data from a database using SQL query
    SELECT *
    FROM global_data

    SELECT *
    FROM city_list
    WHERE country='Vietnam';

    SELECT *
    FROM city_data
    WHERE city='Hanoi';
